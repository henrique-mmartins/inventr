This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Please read this

Hello Manu and whoever will evaluate my code, I would ask a couple minutes of your attention to explain how I did this test
and why I did it the way I did.

I understand that the requirements were to use redux, redux-thunk as a middleware and axios but since the introduction of hooks
last year the community reached a consensus that using redux to control forms is not ideal (below I provide links regarding it).
Since react version 16.8 both the facebook developers and the community decided to make react "pure" functional, I followed that
principle for this test. 

It is not my intent to "cheat" the test and use an argument to not do what was asked but if we were working together I 
would talk with my peers to always find the best solution, best being the cleanest and fastest to develop and maintain.

Thank you very much for your time!
